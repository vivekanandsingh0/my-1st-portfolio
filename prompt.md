"Create a highly interactive, futuristic personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with premium UI/UX. The website must feel modern, 3D-oriented, and visually immersive — combining WebGL, Three.js, GSAP animations, parallax motion, particle effects, and subtle VR-style interactions. The site should look like a tech founder / full-stack developer showcase.

Overall Style & Vibe

Clean, sharp, modern UI with high-quality graphics

Tech-savvy, startup-minded aesthetic

Smooth animations with GSAP or CSS transitions

Use 3D elements using Three.js (e.g., rotating 3D shapes, models, floating objects, abstract galaxy, digital spheres)

VR-style camera movement on mouse hover

Parallax layers reacting to cursor movement

Dark theme with neon blue/purple accents (cyber-tech look) or a modern gradient theme

Should feel like browsing a futuristic dashboard or tech founder’s holographic interface

1. Hero Section (3D + VR Interaction)

Build a striking hero section with:

Full-screen WebGL/Three.js 3D environment

Floating 3D particles or abstract geometric shapes

My name displayed with a glowing, bold, futuristic font

Subtitle: “Full Stack Developer • Tech Builder • Startup Mindset”

Interactive cursor effects (light trails, ripples, or aura)

Hover-reveal photography or silhouette effect

Buttons with micro-animations: “View Projects”, “Download Resume”, “Contact Me”

Optional: rotating 3D model of a sphere, cube, or a digital world behind the text

2. About Me (Smooth Scroll + Animated Cards)

Create a highly polished About section:

Animated cards sliding in using GSAP

My profile image in a rounded neon frame or 3D tilt effect

Text should highlight:

Full Stack Developer

Startup mindset

Problem solver

Tech-savvy

Networking and leadership qualities

Use a soft glow effect and subtle motion on scroll.

3. Skills Section (Interactive UI)

Make skills visually dynamic:

Use neumorphic or holographic cards

On hover, the card should tilt in 3D

Icons should glow or animate

Group into:

Full-Stack: HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, APIs, Databases

System & Tech: Linux, Windows, Networking

Soft Skills: Leadership, consistency, communication

Startup Skills: prototyping, problem-solving

Optional: radial skill chart that animates.

4. Projects Section (High Graphics + 3D Thumbnails)

This section should feel like entering a digital gallery.

Each project tile is a 3D card

Hover to rotate slightly in 3D

Clicking opens a modal or expands into a full project page

Include advanced animations using GSAP timelines

Project ideas: portfolio website, full-stack apps, micro-startup experiments, system setups, event management tools, etc.

Add a light VR-style neon grid behind the cards.

5. Experience & Achievements (Minimal + Classy)

Make this section clean yet stylish:

Use vertical timeline with glowing connectors

Each milestone slides in gently

Include:

Leadership in Cultural Committee

Event organization

Technical experimentation

Startup-oriented projects

Continuous learning

Add subtle animated icons

6. Contact Section (Animated + Modern)

VR-style map or animated glowing lines background

Contact form with smooth success animation

Neon buttons

Icons that animate on hover

Include links to GitHub, LinkedIn, Email

7. Navigation

Sticky navbar with transparent glassmorphism

On scroll, navbar darkens with blur

Smooth scrolling

Section highlight indicator

8. Mobile Responsive

Ensure:

All animations scale down

3D objects simplify or switch to 2D mode

No heavy VR elements on mobile

9. Technical Requirements

Use pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Allowed libraries:

Three.js (3D models)

GSAP or Anime.js (animations)

AOS for scroll animations

particles.js for backgrounds

No React or frameworks unless absolutely needed

Optimized performance, modular code

10. Final Touches

Add loading screen with a progress bar

Add a custom cursor that reacts to elements

Use modern fonts (Poppins, Inter, Space Grotesk, Orbitron)

Use SVG icons for crisp visuals

Add light sound effects on hover (optional)

Output Format

Deliver complete HTML, CSS, and JS files, including:

Three.js setup

All animations

All interactions

Organized folder structure (assets, scripts, styles, models)

Clean and commented code

⚡ FINAL NOTE

The final portfolio must look premium, futuristic, interactive, and unique — like a modern tech founder or full-stack developer’s personal 3D showcase.
Focus on visuals, responsiveness, animations, and clarity.
